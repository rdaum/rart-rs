## Conclusion

**ART provides a well-balanced general-purpose choice**, offering:

- Strong sequential performance (10x improvement)
- Competitive random access
- Predictable scaling characteristics
- Reasonable insertion performance

The choice between data structures depends heavily on access patterns, with ART providing the best
balance across diverse workloads while excelling in sequential scenarios.
